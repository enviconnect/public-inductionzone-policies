# Code of Conduct
The Induction Zone is a place for people to exchange news, views, ideas, and experience and appear authentically (i.e., speak in a way that is aligned with their own beliefs and experience and not need to present a facade). We encourage all users of our infrastructure to respect this and support each other. 

This does not mean that differences of opinion, or debate, are not allowed. Instead, we encourage respectful, constructive discussion and recognition that others' opinions are also valid.

Demeaning or derogatory language, harrasment, hate speech, or discrimination will not be tolerated.

## Diversity, equality, and inclusion (DEI)
To the extent allowed by law, we strive to include anyone and everyone in the Induction Zone regardless of gender, sexual preference, age, national origin, educational background, or other differentiating characteristic.

All users of the Induction Zone infrastructure are requested to follow the same principles of respecting, supporting, and encouraging diversity, equality, and inclusion when using the Induction Zone infrastructure.

Please note that only persons aged 18 or over will be given access to the Induction Zone.

## Reporting activities that go against the code of conduct
We encourage anyone who feels that they have experienced behaviour that goes against this code of conduct during an Induction Zone event, or during their use of Induction Zone infrastructure, or during any other activity related to the Induction Zone, to contact induction.zone@enviconnect.de with a detailed description of what happened.

## How we will deal with activities that go against the code of conduct
If we observe activities that go against this code of conduct, or have such reported to us, we will take steps to stop them. These steps may include, but is not limited to:

- verbal or written warnings
- temporary or permanent removal of access to the infrastructure
- referal to applicable law enforcement.

## If you feel that _we_ have gone against this code of conduct

You take full responsibility for your intellectual property and agree to protect it at all times.
