The Induction Zone is a place for people to exchange news, views, ideas,
and experience and appear authentically (i.e., speak in a way that is
aligned with their own beliefs and experience and not need to present a
facade). We encourage all users of our infrastructure to respect this
and support each other.

This does not mean that differences of opinion, or debate, are not
allowed. Instead, we encourage respectful, constructive discussion and
recognition that others' opinions are also valid.

Demeaning or derogatory language, harrasment, hate speech, or
discrimination will not be tolerated.

\hypertarget{diversity-equality-and-inclusion-dei}{%

national origin, educational background, or other differentiating
characteristic.

All users of the Induction Zone infrastructure are requested to follow
the same principles of respecting, supporting, and encouraging
diversity, equality, and inclusion when using the Induction Zone
infrastructure.
